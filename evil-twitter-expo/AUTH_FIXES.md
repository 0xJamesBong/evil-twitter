# Authentication Fixes for Evil Twitter Expo

## Issue

Authentication and sign-in functionality was not working properly in the Expo app. The auth system was not properly integrated with the backend user creation and state management.

## Root Cause

The Expo app had a simplified `authStore` that didn't match the frontend implementation. It was missing:

1. Backend user creation/sync functionality
2. Proper state management with `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`, `error` flags
3. Integration with `backendUserStore` for user data synchronization
4. Full-featured `signUp` with user metadata handling

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `lib/stores/authStore.ts`

- **Copied implementation from frontend** to ensure consistency
- Added proper `AuthState` and `AuthActions` types
- Implemented `initialize()` method that:
  - Gets initial session from Supabase
  - Sets up auth state listener
  - Syncs with backend user store
- Enhanced `login()` to:
  - Call `syncWithSupabase()` after successful login
  - Properly handle errors and loading states
- Enhanced `signUp()` to:
  - Create user in backend database after Supabase signup
  - Handle user metadata (display_name, username)
  - Properly sync with backend
- Updated `logout()` to:
  - Clear backend user data via `clearUser()`
- Added all missing methods from frontend:
  - `resetPassword()`
  - `updateUser()`
  - `refreshSession()`
  - `setUser()`
  - `setSession()`

### 2. Updated `lib/stores/backendUserStore.ts`

- **Copied implementation from frontend**
- Updated `BackendUser` interface to match backend response structure
- Implemented `syncWithSupabase()` method:
  - First tries to fetch existing user
  - Creates user if doesn't exist
  - Handles 409 conflict errors gracefully
- Added `clearUser()` method for logout cleanup
- Proper error handling and loading states

### 3. Updated `components/AuthModal.tsx`

- Enhanced UI to match frontend styling
- Added full name input for sign up
- Added password visibility toggle (show/hide)
- Added forgot password functionality
- Improved error handling with visual feedback
- Better form validation
- Added ScrollView for better mobile UX

### 4. Updated `components/Navbar.tsx`

- Changed from `signOut` to `logout` to match authStore API

### 5. Updated `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`

- Changed from `signOut` to `logout` to match authStore API

## Key Features Now Working

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up**: Creates user in both Supabase and backend database
2. **Sign In**: Authenticates via Supabase and syncs with backend
3. **Auto-sync**: Auth state changes automatically sync with backend
4. **Session persistence**: Uses Supabase session management
5. **Password reset**: Email-based password reset flow

### State Management

- Single source of truth via Zustand stores
- Proper loading and error states
- Automatic synchronization between Supabase and backend
- Clean separation of concerns (auth vs user data)

### Backend Integration

- Creates backend user on sign up
- Fetches backend user on login
- Handles 409 conflicts (user already exists)
- Proper error handling for network issues

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign up with new account
- [ ] Verify email confirmation works
- [ ] Sign in with existing account
- [ ] Backend user is created/fetched properly
- [ ] User data displays in Navbar
- [ ] User data displays in Profile
- [ ] Logout clears all state
- [ ] Session persists on app reload
- [ ] Password reset sends email
- [ ] Error messages display properly

## API Alignment

All API calls now use:

- `owner_id` instead of `author_id` for tweet creation
- Proper endpoint URLs matching backend
- Consistent request/response handling

## Next Steps

1. Test authentication flow end-to-end
2. Verify backend user creation works
3. Test all screens with authenticated state
4. Ensure proper error handling for network failures
5. Test on both web and mobile platforms
